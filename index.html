  <p>
    Hello, my name is Shanythia Richards, also known as Shanii. I have been what feels like a vagabond for years; I recently quit the only job I truly enjoyed recently to pursue the career I have been preparing myself for unknowingly for years. A relaxing hobby was turning into currently something more significant than I could have ever imagined. I am very excited to see my skills refined for the workforce. ( soon to be revamped )

    More about me coming soon!
